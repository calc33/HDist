BuildSum [<target-dir>] [options]

BuildSum generates a list of SHA1 checksums for the files in the directory specified by <target-dir>
with the name "_index.sha".
If <target-dir> is omitted, the current directory will be used.

Options:
  --compress <compress-dir>
  -c <compress-dir>
      Directory for storing compressed files. Files are compressed in bzip2 format.
      You can reduce the load on the network by using compressed files.
      If specified as a relative path, it will be a relative path from <target-dir>.
      The recommended setting is "..\bzip2".
      Note: When distributing via HTTP(s), the HTTP server's compression function is used to
            achieve the same functionality, so creating compressed files here will be ignored.

  --ignore <name>
  -i <name>
      file or directory name to ignore when creating the list. Wildcards are accepted.
      If you want to specify multiple file names, specify this option multiple times.
      Use exclusively with --ignore-list.

  --ignore-list <filename>
  -I <filename>
      Specify the list of file or directory names to be ignored when creating the list in the file.
      Separate each element with a line break. Wildcards are accepted.
      Use exclusively with --ignore.

  --include-hidden
  -h
      Include hidden files in the list.
